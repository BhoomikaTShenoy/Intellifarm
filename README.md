## Intellifarm smart-farming solutions
Welcome to IntelliFarm! This project aims to revolutionize traditional farming by integrating smart technologies like Machine Learning and PyQt5 to enhance crop and fertilizer management. Our solution provides farmers with intelligent recommendations, helping them make data-driven decisions to increase yield, reduce waste, and promote sustainable farming practices.

### Features
- **Crop Prediction:** Suggests the best crops to plant based on N,P,K, weather, and other environmental factors.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Recommends the optimal type and amount of fertilizer to use for maximum yield.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate GUI built with PyQT5, offering a seamless experience for farmers.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Uses machine learning models to analyze data and generate actionable insights.

### Project Structure
- **/data:** Contains datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- **/models:** Machine learning models used for crop and fertilizer predictions.
- **/gui:** Source code for the graphical user interface built using PyQT5.
- **/scripts:** Python scripts for data processing, model training, and prediction.
- **/docs:** Documentation and resources for understanding and using IntelliFarm.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used for model development and data processing.
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression for predictive analytics.
- **PyQT5:** For building the graphical user interface.
